### Assignment:

1. (pari-dispari) - Ask the user for a number between 1 and 5, then generate a random number between the same values. Ask the user whether they want to bet on even or odd, then sum up the user's number and the randomly generated one and log to console whether the user has won or lost.

2. (palindroma) - Ask the user for a word and check whether it's a palindrome.

### Goals:

Practice the use of functions to write cleaner, reusable code.
